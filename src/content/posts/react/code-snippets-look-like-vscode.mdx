Have you ever wanted your code blocks in blog posts to look just like they do in VS Code? You're not alone — and now it's easier than ever to achieve that look!

Here’s what we’ll use:

- [`react-syntax-highlighter`](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter)
- The `vscDarkPlus` Prism theme
- Some TailwindCSS padding and rounding for aesthetics

## The CodeBlock Component

We created a `CodeBlock.tsx` that uses the VS Code–like `vscDarkPlus` theme. Here's a sample usage:

```tsx
import { Prism as SyntaxHighlighter } from "react-syntax-highlighter";
import { vscDarkPlus } from "react-syntax-highlighter/dist/esm/styles/prism";

<SyntaxHighlighter language="tsx" style={vscDarkPlus}>
  {code}
</SyntaxHighlighter>;
```
